# Define the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Add L2 regularization
model.regularization = l2(0.01)

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

#In AI, regularization is a technique used to prevent a machine learning model from overfitting the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. This can lead to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization adds a penalty to the model's loss function, which encourages the model to be more general.
#
#There are two main types of regularization:
#
#Lasso regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients. This encourages the model to have fewer features with large coefficients.
#Ridge regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the squares of the model's coefficients. This encourages the model to have smaller coefficients overall.
#Regularization is an important technique for preventing overfitting and improving the performance of machine learning models. It is often used in conjunction with other techniques, such as cross-validation, to tune the hyperparameters of a model.
#
#Here are some of the benefits of using regularization:
#
#Improved generalization: Regularization can help to improve the generalization performance of a model by preventing it from overfitting the training data.
#Reduced variance: Regularization can help to reduce the variance of a model by making it less sensitive to small changes in the training data.
#Increased robustness: Regularization can help to make a model more robust to noise and outliers in the training data.
#Here are some of the challenges of using regularization:
#
#Overfitting: If the regularization hyperparameters are not chosen correctly, it is possible for regularization to actually lead to overfitting.
#Computational complexity: Regularization can increase the computational complexity of training a model.
#Interpretability: Regularization can make it more difficult to interpret the results of a model.
