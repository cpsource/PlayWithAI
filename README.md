# PlayWithAI
This is my playpen for mucking about with AI. This should be of no use to anyone.

As for hardware, I have an Alienware x14 gamer laptop running windows 11. The hardware has built-in Nvidia graphics card with about 2500 cuda cores, which, it turns out, will work with TensorFlow, etc.

The box also supports Ubuntu native in w11. Neet, actually, but getting it running was a bear. I made one mistake
when I purchased the box in that I didn't get enough disk space. I added a Seagate 1tb external drive to a usb port.
It's reliable but slow but works better than a Sandisk drive, which I wasted money on.

If you don't want to configure a box, run Google's Colab. It's pre-configured and comes with a Jupyter interface (I think.) Quite a sweet toy. But I prefer to set my own box up.

I created this sandbox on github to test everything.

As for getting technical help, I use bard.google.com. It's great at high-level questions, such as what is a GPU vs TPU, but really terrible with actual programming.

I use Evernote as a web clipper with a Chrome browser.
