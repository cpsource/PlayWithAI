"Passe composé" and "imparfait" are two commonly used past tenses in the French language. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. **Formation**:
   - **Passe composé**: It is a compound tense, meaning it uses two parts: the auxiliary verb (either "avoir" or "être") in the present tense followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example: "j'ai mangé" (I ate/have eaten).
   - **Imparfait**: It is a simple tense formed by using a single verb form. For example: "je mangeais" (I was eating).

2. **Usage**:
   - **Passe composé**: 
     - Describes specific actions or events that happened at a specific time in the past.
     - Emphasizes the beginning or the end of an action.
     - Describes a series of completed actions.
     - Often used with expressions like "hier" (yesterday), "la semaine dernière" (last week), etc.
   - **Imparfait**:
     - Describes ongoing or continuous actions or situations in the past.
     - Provides background information or sets the scene.
     - Describes habitual actions or states in the past.
     - Often used with expressions like "toujours" (always), "souvent" (often), "parfois" (sometimes), etc.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Passe composé**: "Il a appelé à 9 heures." (He called at 9 o'clock.)
   - **Imparfait**: "Il appelait souvent." (He used to call often.)

4. **Nuances**:
   - In many situations, both tenses can be used, but the meaning might change slightly. For instance:
     - "Quand j'étais jeune, je jouais au tennis." (When I was young, I used to play tennis.) - Describes a habitual action in the past using "imparfait".
     - "Quand j'étais jeune, j'ai joué au tennis." (When I was young, I played tennis.) - Refers to a specific instance or instances in the past using "passe composé".

In summary, while both "passe composé" and "imparfait" refer to past actions, "passe composé" is used for specific, completed actions, whereas "imparfait" is used for ongoing, habitual, or background actions in the past. The choice between them often depends on the context and the speaker's intention.
